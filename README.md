# higgs

Small project to solve for the mass of the higgs boson particle. The goal was to see if it matches with the theoretically predicted value.


higgs.py: This is where the real work is done

ode.py is just me trying to figure out how the integration and initial value problems and interpolation work

yukawa.py is an older version that is obsolete


Paper that I based the work off of:

B. A. Ovrut, A. Purves and S. Spinner, “A statistical analysis of the minimal SUSY BL theory,” Mod. Phys. Lett.
A 30, no. 18, 1550085 (2015) doi:10.1142/S0217732315500856 [arXiv:1412.6103 [hep-ph]].
